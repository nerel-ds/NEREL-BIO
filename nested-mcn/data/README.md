## Concept Normalization over Nested Entities

We release biomedical entity normalization annotation over nested entities in two formats:

* [BRAT format](https://github.com/nerel-ds/NEREL-BIO/tree/master/nested-mcn/data/brat);

* [BioSyn format](https://github.com/dmis-lab/BioSyn). 


## Nested normalization baselines

Source code for nested entity normalization will be released shortly.
