[The efficacy and safety of teraligen in patients with brain ischemia, stages I and II, and psychoautonomic syndrome]. OBJECTIVE To assess the efficacy and safety of teraligen in patients with psychoautonomic syndrome comorbid to brain ischemia. MATERIAL AND METHODS  Forty-five patients, aged from 42 to 65 years (mean age 56 years), diagnosed with brain ischemia, stages I and II, with the signs of psychoautonomic syndrome were examined. Thirty-five patients received teraligen in the daily dose of 15 mg.  The control group comprised 10 patients who were not treated with this drug. The duration of treatment was 60 days. Neurological status, autonomic changes, cognitive functions and mental state were assessed during the treatment.  Neurophysiological examination (EEG and P300 event-related potential) were performed in the first and last visits. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  The distinct positive dynamics of the decrease of psychoautonomic symptoms, cephalgic syndrome, sleep normalization as well as the improvement of cognitive function were noted. Good tolerability and no side-effects, in particular, those related to vascular disorders, were demonstrated. Clinical results were supported by the results of neurophysiological examinations.  The drug can be recommended for treatment of psychoautonomic syndrome in elderly patients with brain ischemia, stages I and II.
