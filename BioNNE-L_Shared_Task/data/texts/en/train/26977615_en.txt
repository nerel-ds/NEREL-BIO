[Prevention and treatment of post-traumatic pancreatic necrosis in patients with blunt abdominal trauma].  INTRODUCTION High incidence of necrotic and suppurative complications is feature of acute post-traumatic pancreatitis.  Severe trauma of the pancreas and post-traumatic pancreatitis lead to depressurization of ductal system that requires adequate drainage of damaged area and retroperitoneal fat. MATERIAL AND METHODS 95 patients in group 1 received standardized treatment. The victims of the 2nd group (44 patients) were treated using immunoreactive therapy (roncoleukin) and octreotide (the dose depended on the severity of pancreatitis) at early stages.  The efficacy of treatment was assessed based on clinical, laboratory and instrumental parameters. RESULTS  Regardless severity of pancreatic injury overall mortality in groups 1 and 2 was 41% and 20.5% respectively. The main causes of adverse outcomes are severe destructive pancreatitis, postnecrotic suppurative complications. CONCLUSION Adequacy rather radicalism of surgery should be preferred for blunt pancreatic trauma management.  Minimally invasive surgical techniques and new methods of biological hemostasis may be applied. Timely use of anti-enzymatic and immunoactive therapy reduces the risk of severe post-traumatic pancreatitis, suppurative complications and improves outcomes in patients with blunt pancreatic trauma.
