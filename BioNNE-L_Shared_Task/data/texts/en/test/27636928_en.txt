[Multiple primary colorectal cancer: Clinical aspects].
AIM  to define some clinical characteristics of synchronous and metachronous colorectal cancer (CRC).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The investigation was concerned with the data of 150 patients with T1-4N0-2M0-1 multiple primary CRC.
The clinical, biological, and morphological characteristics of synchronous and metachronous tumors were analyzed.
RESULTS
Multiple primary tumors were 6.01% of all the cases of CRC.
There was a preponderance of synchronous CRC (63.75%) with the tumor localized in the sigmoid colon and rectum.
In women, synchronous colorectal tumors were more often concurrent with breast tumors; metachronous ones were detected after treatment for genital tumors.
In men, synchronous colorectal tumors were more frequently concurrent with kidney cancer; metachronous ones were identified after treatment for gastric cancer.
CONCLUSION
The found characteristics of multiple primary colorectal tumors may be taken in account in programs for both primary diagnosis and follow-up after treatment for malignant tumors, which will be able to improve the early detection of cancer patients and their treatment results.
