[Treatment of rectal foreign bodies].  AIM
to present the results of treatment of rectal foreign bodies.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  15-year outcomes of 112 patients with rectal foreign bodies were analyzed.
RESULTS
Outpatient and hospital care were applied in 52 (46%) and 60 (54%) of cases respectively.
Transanal removal was made in 97 (87%) patients including 28 (25%) cases of general anaesthesia.
14 (13%) patients underwent surgery.
Colostomy was performed in 7 (6%) cases.
We presented cases of foreign bodies removal through laparotomy, colotomy and SILS-assisted transanal approach.
DISCUSSION
From clinical point of view foreign bodies should be first of all classified by their dimensions.
Anamnesis and physical examination are very important.
Abdominal X-ray survey is obligatory.
Transanal removal under general anaesthesia is advisable if perforation is absent.
If such procedure is impossible laparotomy is indicated.
CONCLUSION
Algorithm of survey and treatment is presented.
