[Oxidative stress as an indicator of metabolic disorders in the pathogenesis of cerebral stroke].
AIM  To verify the oxidative stress as an indicator of metabolic disorders in the complex pathogenesis of hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 50 hemorrhagic stroke patients and 50 ischemic stroke patients.
A control group consisted of 20 age-matched healthy subjects.  In total 12 biochemical parameters, including blood indicators, indicators of free-radical oxidation (ketodiens, diene conjugates, malonic aldehyde, bityrosin, Schiff bases) and endogenous system antioxidant defense (vitamin E, reduced glutathione, total antioxidative activity, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, catalase) were determined.
RESULTS
An increase in free-radical oxidation of lipids and proteins as well as functional imbalance in non-enzymatic and enzymatic links of endogenous antioxidant defense system were found in patients with hemorrhagic stroke and ischemic stroke compared to controls.
CONCLUSION
The findings obtained in the study have made it possible to identify two factors in the oxidative stress formation in hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke that will extend the knowledge about the pathogenesis of this severe vascular process.
