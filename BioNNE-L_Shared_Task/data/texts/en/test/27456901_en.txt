[The possibility of using standardized self-report anxiety and depression scales in elderly patients: anxiety scales/questionnaires].
AIM  To describe the specifics of using self-report anxiety scales in elderly patients, determine the parameters of their reliability and validity and develop recommendations on the use of these scales.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 234 patients, aged over 50 years, with non-psychotic anxiety disorders.
The following scales/questionnaires BAI, GAI, STAI, ZAS, HADS were used at baseline and 12 weeks after treatment.
Conditions of testing, form and content of instructions were similar.
Data analysis included the estimation of reliability and validity of these scales.
Assessment made by the physician on the Hamilton anxiety scale (HAМ-А) was used as «validity standard».
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
All scales (BAI, GAI, STAI, ZAS, HADS-А) can be used for screening diagnosis of anxiety in elderly people.
The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the scales for subjective assessment of anxiety slightly decrease in advanced age and is sufficient for screening purposes.
Based on the analysis, the authors have developed recommendations (common and specific for each scale) on the optimization of using self-report anxiety scales in advanced age.
