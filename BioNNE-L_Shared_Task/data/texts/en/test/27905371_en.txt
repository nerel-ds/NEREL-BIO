[Management of locally advanced colon cancer with duodenal invasion].  AIM
To present 7 cases of radical surgical treatment of colon cancer with duodenal invasion.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Mean age of patients was 72.3 years.  1 patient underwent pancreatoduodenectomy with right-sided hemicolectomy en bloc.
In 6 patients right-sided hemicolectomy with atypical duodenectomy were performed.
Herewith, the defect was sutured in 1 case.  In 5 patients the defect was closed by duodenojejunostomy with initial intestinal loop.
RESULTS
There was no postoperative mortality.
Recurrence-free 3-year survival was 71.4% (5 patients).
It was concluded that atypical duodenectomy is possible in case of local duodenal invasion of colon cancer.
