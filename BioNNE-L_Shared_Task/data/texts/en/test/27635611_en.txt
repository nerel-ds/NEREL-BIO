[Clinical significance of the cardio-ankle vascular index in patients with stroke].
AIM
To study the clinical significance of the cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) in patients with stroke.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 374 post-stroke patients.  The state of peripheral arteries was assessed using CAVI and the ankle-shoulder index (ASI).
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The pathological CAVI (>9.0) was identified in 45.4% patients, the reduced ASI (<0.9) in 19.8% patients.
Stressful factors of daily life, hypodynamia, lack of work, low education were characteristic of the patients with pathological CAVI and ASI compared to those with normal CAVI.
The frequency of diabetes mellitus, clinical signs of peripheral atherosclerosis, chronic heart failure and atrial fibrillation was higher in these patients as well.
Ischemic stroke was more frequent in patients with peripheral atherosclerosis and higher vascular wall rigidity.  Assessments of CAVI and ASI are necessary in patients with ischemic stroke to identify those with higher vascular wall rigidity and peripheral atherosclerosis and to undertake targeted preventive measures.
