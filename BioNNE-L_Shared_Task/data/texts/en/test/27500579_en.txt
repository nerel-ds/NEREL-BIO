[Local cytokine therapy of inflammation of the rhinosinusotubal area].  The objective of the present work was to elaborate a scheme for the effective combined treatment ofinflammation of the rhinosinusotubal area including the local administration of roncoleukin and cyclopheron without antibiotics.
The study included 82 patients (27 men and 55 women) at the age from 25 to 55 years presenting with acute inflammation ofroncoleukin and cycloferon.
They were divided into two groups.  Group 1 was comprised of 39 patients dominated by those with the clinical picture of sinusitis whereas group 2 contained 43 patients in whom symptoms of catarrhal otitis media prevailed.
The patients of both groups were treated by the local application of roncoleukin in combination with cycloferon inhalation, intranasal administration of decongestants and mucomodifiers.
All the patients underwent, before and after the treatment, the microbiological study of the contents of the sinuses, impedancobarometry, 3D computed tomography, and measurement of the IgA, IgM, IgG, IgE, SIgA, IL-8, TNF-alpha, and albumin levels in the blood sera and lavages.
The study has demonstrated the difference between the local cytokine levels in the two groups of the patients.
The clinical improvement was documented within 24 hours after the onset of therapy.
93.3% of the patients recovered by day 5.
Three (3.7%) of them had to be prescribed antibiotic therapy for the lack of the desired effect of the cytokine treatment.
It is concluded that the local application of ronkoleukin and cycloferon in combination with elimination therapy provides a tool for the efficient treatment of the patients suffering frominflammatory pathology of the rhinosinusotubalzone due to its stimulatory action on the immune system at the inflammation site mediated through the activation of the earlier formed targeted immune response, the promotion of the accelerated elimination of the causative factor, and the termination of the pathological process.
