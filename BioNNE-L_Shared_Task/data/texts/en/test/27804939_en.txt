[The morphology, typical combinations of polymorphic genes of hemostasis, and specific features of the pathogenesis of retrochorial hematoma in missed abortion].  AIM
to identify mutations and hemostatic gene polymorphisms typical for retrochorial hematoma (RCH) and to study its pathogenesis in missed abortion.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS  A PCR assay was used to detect the genetic forms of thrombophilia in 270 patients with ultrasonographically verified RCH.
Logistic regression analysis revealed that with the F7  (proconvertin, coagulation factor (CF) VII G10976A polymorphism or with the F13 (fibrinase, CF XIII) G>T, or FGB (fibrinogen β-chain) G455A polymorphism, the risk of RCH was 2.72, 2.16, and 1.92 times higher, respectively.
First trimester missed abortion was found in 42 (15.5%) cases; among them there were 24 (8.8%) women with different polymorphism combinations: F7 (G10976A), F13 (fibrinase, G>T), FGB (G455A).
A total of 18 cases of missed abortion due to morphologically verified endometritis, endocrinopathies, and antiphospholipid syndrome were excluded from the sample.
RESULTS
Compared to the morphology of medical abortions of the same period (16 women), patients with polymorphic genes of hemostasis were found to have statistically significant incomplete endometrial decidualization, thinning or absence of a Rohr's fibrinoid layer, a smaller number and shortening of syncytiotrophoblast microvilli, and the maximum amount of dissecting hemorrhage and RCH in the utero-chorionic region.
The stages of RCH pathogenesis were determined; these included penetration of maternal erythrocytes deep into the decidua ~ dissociation of a layer of decidual cells with impairment of a «hemostatic envelope» ~ formation of RCH with a dense network of fibrin threads ~ final necrosis of surrounding cells and tissues.
CONCLUSION
The investigators identified for the first time the typical combinations of polymorphic genes of predisposition to a high risk for RCH; its complete formation requires additional changes in maternal and placental components that provide local hemostasis.
