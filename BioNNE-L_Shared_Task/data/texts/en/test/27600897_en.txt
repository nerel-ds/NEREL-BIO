AIM  to evaluate the effectiveness of prolatan (latanoprost 0.005%) in the treatment of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 35 POAG patients (41 eyes) aged 55-72 years, of them 20 men and 15 women.
The patients were randomized into two groups followed up for 3 months.
Group 1 consisted of 17 patients (19 eyes) who received prolatan once daily in the evening.
Group 2 consisted of 18 patients (22 eyes) under Xalatan 0.005% once daily in the evening.
RESULTS
The true intraocular pressure (IOP) decreased by the average of 28.6%.
Analysis of perimetry results showed a statistically reliable increase in the MD - by 17.4% in the study group and by 20% in the control group, and PSD indices - by 10.7% and 11.9%, respectively.
Optical coherence tomography revealed an improvement of optic disc parameters in both groups.
In particular, the cup volume decreased reliably by 8.4% and 6.3% and cup area - by 24.4% and 28.5%, respectively, while the rim area increased by 20.8% and 17.9%, respectively.
The patients complained of neither burning, nor discomfort, nor foreign body sensation after prolatan instillations.  We also report the absence of side effects.
CONCLUSION  The study has proved high antihypertensive effectiveness of prolatan.
Improved morphometric parameters of the optic disc (decreased cup volume and area, increased rim area) indirectly indicate the neuroprotective potential of the drug.
Being well-tolerated by the patients, prolatan can be recommended as the first choice treatment of glaucoma.
