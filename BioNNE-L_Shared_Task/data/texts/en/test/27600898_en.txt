[Ocular surface viral diseases in children].  UNLABELLED  Over the past 15 years the number of children with inflammatory eye diseases has increased by five-six times.
Data analysis of Moscow children's health clinics in 2014 showed that for 40,000 outpatients a viral infection was observed in 49,000 cases, whereas some children suffered from the viral infection twice or thrice. 344 children (0.7 percent) had the viral infection accompanied by keratoconjunctivitis.
According to 2015 data, viral infection was observed in 37,957 children, including 325 outpatients (0.8 percent) with keratoconjunctivitis.
AIM  To analyze clinical features and treatment options of ocular surface viral diseases in children.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
We observed 140 children aged 2 to 13 years with ocular surface viral diseases.
RESULTS
Despite the presence of corneal disorders, in 95 percent of children changes were reversible - in 1.5 months corneal opacity was not observed.
Yet five percent of children, despite the intensive treatment, had bacterial complications, causing decrease in visual acuity.
CONCLUSION
In case of viral infections, ophthalmologists, pediatricians and general practitioners should all be aware of ocular manifestations of these diseases.
Even if adequate therapy for ocular surface viral disorders is appointed, in five percent of cases complications are possible, causing decline in visual function.
Changes in vision can be a result of general disease manifestation, and only timely and proper treatment will help to relieve the symptoms of inflammation and prevent complications.
The results of our observations revealed that the addition of Ophtalmoferon medication to the complex therapy of ocular surface diseases in children showed a high therapeutic efficacy and a good safety profile.
This medication, in contrast to other antiviral agents, is available in the form of ready-to-use eye drops, significantly enhancing medication compliance in outpatients.
