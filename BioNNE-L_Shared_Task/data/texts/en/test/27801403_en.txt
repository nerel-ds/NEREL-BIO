[A technique of TachoComb application in dura mater reconstruction in surgery for posterior cranial fossa tumors].
INTRODUCTION
Liquorrhea is a condition characterized by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage from the cranial cavity due to injury to the integrity of the dura mater (DM) and bone structures of the skull base.  Surgery for posterior cranial fossa (PCF) lesions distinguishes wound CSF leakage when CSF leaks from a surgical wound as well as basal CSF leakage (nasal liquorrhea and, less often, otoliquorrhea).
The main cause of basal CSF leakage is injury (including surgical injury) resulting in a defect in the DM and bone structures (cells of the mastoid process in the case of a suboccipital retrosigmoid approach).
There are a variety of DM restoration techniques ranging from DM closure or placement of a synthetic or autologous patch to application of various synthetic adhesives in the form of adhesive compositions (Tissucol) and adhesive substances (TachoComb).
This article describes the experience with application of a TachoComb® sponge gained at the 5th Clinical Department of the Burdenko Neurosurgical Institute.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 176 patients with acoustic neurinomas.  At the final stage of surgery, all the patients underwent DM reconstruction with a TachoComb® collagen sponge.
CSF leakage occurred in 3 (1.7%) patients, with each of them having Koos grade 4 tumor.
One (0.56%) patient had wound liquorrhea, and 2 (1.1%) patients had nasal liquorrhea.  CSF leakage was managed by placement of a lumbar drain; postoperative wound revision was not required.
CONCLUSION
Using the TachoComb® sponge for DM reconstruction in PCF surgery is an effective way to prevent postoperative CSF leakage, provided that the algorithm of manipulations described in the article is followed.
