[Postoperative applications of the fast track technology in patients with herniated intervertebral discs of the lumbosacral spine].
TOPICALITY  The fast track technology means a complex of targeted measures involving rational preoperative preparation, minimally invasive surgery, regional anesthesia and short-acting anesthetics, and early postoperative rehabilitation.
Elucidating the possibility of applying the fast track technology in neurosurgery, in particular in spinal surgery, is extremely topical.  This is associated with the epidemiological data and the fact that minimally invasive techniques used in neurosurgery are highly expensive.
AIM  The study objective was implementation of the fast track technology and subsequent analysis of its use after surgery in patients with herniated intervertebral discs of the lumbosacral spine.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The fast track technology following spinal surgery was implemented at the Clinical Hospital of the Presidential Administration of the Russian Federation and the Neurosurgical Department of the Clinical Hospital â„– 1 of the Presidential Administration of the Russian Federation using an algorithm of technology application.
The study included 48 patients who underwent surgical treatment for herniated intervertebral discs of the lumbosacral spine between January and July 2015.
RESULTS
An analysis of pain severity using the Visual Analog Scale demonstrated a slight decrease (10%) in a group of patients who were subjected to the fast track technology, at discharge and at 1 month after surgery; there was no difference in longer follow-up.
An analysis of the functional status using the Oswestry index and Roland-Morris scale demonstrated that patients of the study group had faster and more efficient recovery and an improvement of the functional activity by 20% (p<0.05) compared to those in the control group.
An analysis of patient-reported assessment of treatment quality revealed that indicators, such as awareness and pain control, in the study group were highest and amounted to 95% and higher.
An analysis of the hospital stay duration showed a decrease in the number of bed-days in an integrated group by 39%, which saved 34 bed-days.
CONCLUSION
The fast track technology reduces the degree of surgical aggression, increases surgery safety, and decreases the number of intraoperative complications and hospital stay duration.
