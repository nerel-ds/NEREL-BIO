[Incidence of abdominal wall hernias: the results of population study].  AIM
to define the incidence of abdominal wall hernias among ethnically homogeneous population older than 10 years within single locality.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
One-stage investigation of abdominal wall hernias incidence was performed in June-July 2015 in the Kryukovskoye rural settlement of the Borisovskiy district of the Belgorod region.
Citizens were examined in FAPs or at home.  Specially designed questionnaire was used for every person.
Presence of hernia was confirmed by clinical signs or anamnestic data about previous abdominal wall repair.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
783 (86.6%) persons were surveyed.
There were 298 (38%) men and 485 (62%) women among them aged 10-90 years.
Clinical signs or anamnestic data were revealed in 164 (20.9%) persons.
Inguinal (n=80, 10.2%) and umbilical (n=65, 8.3%) hernias were predominant.
Postoperative ventral hernia was diagnosed in 19 (2.4%) humans.
CONCLUSION
Incidence of abdominal wall hernias was 20.9% in our study.
