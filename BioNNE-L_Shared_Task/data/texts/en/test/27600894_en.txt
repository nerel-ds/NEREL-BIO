[Study of vitreomacular interface in patients with pseudophakia by means of spectral optical coherence tomography].  AIM
to investigate the state of vitreomacular interface in pseudophakic patients by means of spectral optical coherence tomography (OCT).
MATERIAL AND METHODS  Spectral OCT of the macular region was performed in 58 pseudophakic eyes that underwent laser treatment for secondary cataract, 28 newly pseudophakic eyes (day 1 after cataract phacoemulsification with IOL implantation), and 40 eyes with early senile cataract.
RESULTS
A higher incidence of subclinical fibrosis of the internal limiting membrane was noted in pseudophakic patients after YAG laser surgery for secondary cataract as compared to cataract patients and those right after cataract phacoemulsification.
CONCLUSION
Fibrosis of the internal limiting membrane significantly more often develops in the late period after cataract extraction as compared to patients with early senile cataract and those who have just underwent phacoemulsification surgery.
Fibrosis of the internal limiting membrane arising in the late period after cataract extraction cannot be unambiguously attributed to either primary or secondary.  The resolution of spectral OCT is high enough to allow detection of preclinical ultrastructural changes in the vitreomacular interface.
