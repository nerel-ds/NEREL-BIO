[Effect of antioxidant therapy on neurotrophins and processes of rehabilitation after stroke].
The aim of the research was to study the effect of the inclusion in the scheme cytoflavin patient care during the recovery period of ischemic stroke in the neuropsychological changes in the status and content of neurotrophins in serum.
For this purpose we surveyed 52 patients who underwent a first ischemic stroke (29 women and 23 men) aged 52-74 years.
Patients were divided into 2 groups: primary (25 patients) received in addition to basic therapy cytoflavin: intravenously at 20 ml per 400 ml of 5% glucose solution, 1 time a day for 10 days, then into 2 tablets 2 times a day for half an hour before food for a month, and the comparison group (27 patients) who received standard treatment.
The control group consisted of 12 healthy people.
In addition to standard clinical and laboratory tests were carried out a comprehensive neuropsychological study and evaluation of the data on the scale NIHSS, Bartell, Beck, Spielberger-Hanin, test «frontal dysfunction of the battery» and the Mini-Mental State Examination.
Furthermore, determination carried neurotrophic factors: nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor brain (BDNF).
The study was conducted in the dynamics: before treatment and 2 months after treatment.
Patients in the recovery period of the first ischemic stroke revealed moderate manifestations of neuropsychological disorders status and reduction of neurotrophic factors.
Inclusion in cytoflavin scheme increased the efficiency of the treatment, which was manifested in a more pronounced when compared with the results of basic therapy, positive dynamics of neurological symptoms and improved cognitive function, accompanied by an increase in BDNF levels.
The data on the efficacy and safety allow us to recommend its inclusion in the scheme of treatment of patients in the recovery period after the first carotid ischemic stroke.
