[Celiac trunk resection in patients with pancreatic cancer and severe pain syndrome].
AIM  To show the advisability, satisfactory tolerance and good analgesic effect of surgery for pancreatic ductal carcinoma with celiac trunk invasion.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Distal subtotal pancreatectomy with resection of celiac trunk and common hepatic artery was made in 21 patients.  RESULTS
Early postoperative complications after distal subtotal pancreatectomy with celiac trunk resection occurred in 10 (47.6%) patients.  There was no postoperative mortality.
Resection edges including retroperitoneal space and pancreas did not contain tumor cells according to histological examination.  Complete analgesic effect was obtained in 100% of patients after distal subtotal pancreatectomy with celiac trunk resection and neurodissection.
1- and 2-year survival was 59.1% and 21.5% respectively in patients with locally advanced pancreatic ductal carcinoma who underwent distal subtotal pancreatectomy with celiac trunk resection, median - 13 months, maximum lifetime - 57 months.
CONCLUSION
Distal subtotal pancreatectomy with resection of celiac trunk and common hepatic artery is safe, provides significant analgesic effect, increases resectability and expands the indications for pancreatectomy.
