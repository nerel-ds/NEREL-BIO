[The effect of reamberin and alpha-lipoic acid on the tolerance to acute cerebral ischemia in experimental diabetes mellitus].  AIM
To study an effect of reamberin and α-lipoic acid (α-LA) on the tolerance of mice with experimental diabetes mellitus (DM) to acute cerebrovascular accident (ACVA) in mice experiments.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The authors studied mice with alloxan diabetes and subtotal and total brain ischemia.  In additional experimental series, an effect of reamberin and α-lipoic acid on the tolerance to acute hypoxic hypoxia and intensity of hyperglycemia in experimental DM was studied.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The increased vulnerability of animals to ACVA due to hyperglycemia and increased sensitivity to acute hypoxic hypoxia was established.  Reamberin and α-lipoic acid administered for 14 days in doses, which are equivalent to therapeutic range in humans, enhance the tolerance to ACVA and acute hypoxic hypoxia in mice with alloxan diabetes.
These medications also decrease the intensity of hyperglycemia during concurrent insulin replacement therapy.
The increased tolerance to ACVA in mice with alloxan diabetes caused by reamberin and alpha-lipoic acid is associated with an antihypoxic effect of these medications and does not depend on their effect on the intensity of hyperglycemia.  Reamberin outperformed α-lipoic acid in the antihypoxic activity, protection against ACVA and the rate of onset of glucose reducing effect in experimental diabetes mellitus.
