[Laparotomy closure in advanced peritonitis].
AIM
to improve the results of advanced peritonitis management.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
743 patients with advanced peritonitis were studied.  Patients were divided into 2 groups depending on treatment strategy.
RESULTS
Programmed relaparotomy combined with removable draining musculoaponeurotic seams during laparotomy closure decreased mortality from 47.8±2.7% to 24.1±2.3% (p<0.001) and provided 4-fold reduction of postoperative suppuration incidence (p<0.001).
Refusal from removable draining musculoaponeurotic seams and use of only cutaneous seams in persistent abdominal hypertension were associated with further decrease of mortality to 15.8±2.7% (p<0.05).
CONCLUSION  Programmed relaparotomy combined with removable draining musculoaponeurotic seams are advisable for advanced peritonitis management.
Laparotomy closure with only cutaneous seams is indicated in case of persistent abdominal hypertension.
Large eventration always requires abdominal wall repair.  APACHE-III scale scores have significant prognostic value in patients with advanced peritonitis.
