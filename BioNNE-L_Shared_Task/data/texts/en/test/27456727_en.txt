[Middle and anterior cerebral arteries dissection as a cause of ischemic stroke in a 7-year-old boy].
Authors describe a 7-year-old boy, who developed a severe right-sided hemiparesis, aphasia, seizure, and confusion state during sport games.
There was no headache.
Allergic dermatitis in the past medical history and influenza vaccination 2 weeks before stroke were recorded.
On the 12th day of disease, MRI of the brain revealed an acute infarction in the territory of left anterior and middle cerebral arteries with hemorrhagic transformation.
MPA (15 day) showed occlusion of the left ACA and MCA.
HR-MRI T1_db_fs weighted imaging (36 day) found intramural hematoma (IMH) in ACA and MCA with marked stenosis of the lumen.
After 3 months, HR-MRI/MRA showed the complete regression of IMH, recanalization of the arterial lumen, prolonged irregular MCA stenosis.
Neurological deficit regressed significantly.
