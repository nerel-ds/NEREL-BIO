[Efficacy of using rivaroxaban for treatment of heat-induced thrombosis after endovenous laser ablation].  AIM  The study was aimed at assessing efficacy of using rivaroxaban for treatment of endothermal heat-induced thrombosis (EHIT) after endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) of saphenous veins.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  Our prospective study included a total of 1,326 patients subjected to 1,514 EVLAs.
In 1,091 (72.1%) cases the great saphenous vein (GSV) was ablated, in 124 (8.2%) cases the anterior accessory vein (AAV) was treated and in 299 (19.7%) cases the small saphenous vein (SSV) was treated.
Heat-induced thrombosis developed in 21 (1.4%) cases: in 19 cases in the basin of the great saphenous vein and in 2 cases in the anterior accessory saphenous vein.
No heat-induced thromboses in the basin of the small saphenous vein were observed.
In 9 (0.6%) cases there was class 1 EHIT (according to the Kabnick classification), class 2 EHIT was noted in 10 (0.7%) cases and class 3 EHIT was observed in 2 (0.1%) cases.
All patients with EHIT were given rivaroxaban: patients with class 1 EHIT received it at a single daily dose of 20 mg, patients with class 2 and 3 EHIT - at a dose of 15 mg twice daily.
In one (4.8%) case the drug had to be discontinued on day two due to the development of dyspeptic events.
All patients were found to have complete regression of the heat-induced thrombus within 6-25 days.
No cases of clinical manifestations of pulmonary artery thromboembolism were observed.
A conclusion was drawn that in clinical practice EHIT is an important and insufficiently studied problem.
Rivaroxaban may be used as an oral agent for treatment of heat-induced thromboses after EVLA.
Further studies are required to examine its efficacy and safety profile.
