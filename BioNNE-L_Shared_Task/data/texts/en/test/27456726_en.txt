[The improvement of treatment efficacy in newborn full-term infants with severe birth asphyxia].
AIM  To investigate the efficacy of cytoflavin as add-on to moderate controlled hypothermia in the treatment of newborn full-term infants with severe birth asphyxia.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Sixty full-term underweight children diagnosed with severe birth asphyxia (Apgar score 4-5) underwent moderate hypothermia for 72 hours.  Depending on the regimen, the children were divided into two equal groups: the basic group received cytoflavin in dose of 2 ml/kg / day and the control group received the traditional scheme of therapy.
RESULTS  The inclusion of cytoflavin increases the efficacy of therapy by reducing the severity of depression of consciousness (the increase in the average total score on the modified Glasgow Coma Scale pediatric/Saint Petersburg by 47.1% in children of the basic group compared with 27.9% in the control group, p=0.04) and more rapid recovery of vital functions (early extubation by 20.3%, p=0.03, and transition to enteral feeding earlier by 16.7% compared with the control group).
The use of cytoflavin in newborns with severe asphyxia reduces lactic acidosis in the blood serum and normalizes EEG parameters as compared to the control group (p=0.02).
CONCLUSION  Cytoflavin can be recommended as adjunctive therapy in full-term infants with severe intrapartum asphyxia.
