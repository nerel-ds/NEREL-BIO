[Diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory diseases of the mammary ducts].  AIM
The analysis and popularization of the own experience of ultrasonic diagnostics and minimal invasive interventions for inflammatory diseases of the mammary ducts.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
249 women were observed: 182 (73.1%) cases of periductal mastitis and 67 (26.9%) cases of purulent galactophoritis.
Patients with purulent galactophoritis were divided into 2 groups (main and control).
The main group consisted of 50 patients after minimal invasive interventions, control - 17 women after traditional surgery.
RESULTS
The main US signs of periductal mastitis and purulent galactophoritis were detected.
Purulent galactophoritis is associated with the diameter of mammary duct less than 4 mm, ductal content flotation and stream-effect (coloring of dilated duct in Doppler mode).
It was proposed the method of US-assisted mini-invasive retrograde drainage of mammary ducts with aspiration of purulent content through the natural orifice in the nipple.
This method doesnot demand hospital stay, reduces duration of treatment by 14 days and doesnot cause the cosmetic defects in comparison with traditional surgical approach.
CONCLUSION
Inflammatory diseases of the mammary ducts are represented by the different nosological forms - periductal mastitis (73.1%) and purulent galactophoritis (26.9%).
In view of typical ultrasonic picture in patients with purulent galactophoritis US-assisted mini-invasive retrograde drainage of mammary ducts with aspiration of purulent content through the natural orifice in the nipple is advisable.
This method has significant advantages in comparison with traditional surgery and may be recommended for widespread clinical use.
