[Efficacy of cortexin in acute and recovery periodes of hemispheric ischemic stroke].
AIM  To study the effectiveness and sustained effects of early appointment of a repeated course of low-dose drug cortexin neuroprotection in patients in acute and recovery period of hemispheric ischemic stroke.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 90 patients with hemispheric ischemic stroke.
Patients of the first group received 20 mg cortexin (10+10) intramuscularly on basic therapy, the patients of the second group (n=30) was obtained cortexin 20 mg (10+10) in the two courses each for 10 days with an interval between them in 10 days, patients of the third group - only basic therapy.
For objectification severity used NIH stroke scale, modified Rankin scale, the Barthel index, the Rivermead mobility index, MMSE.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Appointment in acute hemispheric ischemic stroke drug cortexin repeated course leads to more complete regression of neurological deficit, compared to the comparison group and the group of patients who received one course of medication cortexin, for all acute and early recovery period of ischemic stroke from 11-13 days of illness.
