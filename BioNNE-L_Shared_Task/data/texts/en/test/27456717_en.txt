[The efficacy of tenoten for children in the treatment of motor and speech disorders in children with perinatal damage of the central nervous system].  AIM
To assess the therapeutic efficacy of tenoten for children in perinatal hypoxic CNS damage in children.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  The study included 80 children (56 boys and 24 girls) between the ages of 3 and 3 years and 11 months with different variants (dysontogenetic or encephalopathic) of the effects on the perinatal nervous system.
All children were divided into primary (n=50) and control (n=30) groups.
Children of the primary group received a combination of conventional speech therapy methods with tenoten for children (1 tablet 3 times a day for 12 weeks).
In the control group, children were not treated with tenoten for children.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The inclusion of tenoten in a comprehensive children's speech therapy program contributed significantly to the successful development of both general motor skills and spatial coordination as well as fine motor skills in the hand.
In addition, tenoten significantly decreased signs of dysarthria and improved articulation, specifically in children with dysontogenetic variant of perinatal hypoxic CNS damage.
Tenoten had a positive effect on child's behavior as well.
