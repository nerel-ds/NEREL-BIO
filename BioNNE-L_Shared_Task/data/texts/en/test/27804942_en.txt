[Morphometric and molecular biological features of femoral head tissue in different nosological entities of coxarthrosis].  AIM
to comparatively analyze the morphometric and molecular biological characteristics of femoral head tissue in different nosological entities of coxarthrosis.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
A total of 95 samples of femoral head tissue extirpated during hip endoprosthesis in patients with coxarthrosis were investigated.
Clinical findings were used to identify the following nosological entities of coxarthrosis: dysplastic, postischemic and posttraumatic.
Histological, immunohistochemical and morphometric studies were used.
Osteoclast resorptive activity was assessed by determining the cytoplasmic expression of TRAcP (9C5, «Cell Marque»).
Vasculogenesis was evaluated by estimating the mean area of vessels with CD34 (QBEnd/10, «Ventana») from the positive stained endothelium and by determining the cytoplasmic expression level of VEGF (SP28, «Spring Bio») in osteoblasts and osteoclasts.
RESULTS
Specific histopathological signs were described for each nosological entity of coxarthrosis.
Morphometric analysis could reveal a number of additional characteristics of the magnitude of fibrous changes and the thickness of the articular surface and bone rods.
Immunohistochemical assessment of molecular biological parameters, such as the expression level of VEGF and TRAcP, also pointed to the characteristic features of bony tissue in the above-mentioned nosological entities of coxarthrosis.
In dysplastic coxarthrosis, the maximal expression level of VEGF was recorded in osteoblasts and the expression of VEGF and TRAcP in osteoclasts remained at the minimum level.
The lowest expression of VEGF in osteoblasts was found in posttraumatic coxarthrosis.
In postischemic coxarthrosis, the highest expression of VEGF and TRAcP was recorded in osteoclasts.
CONCLUSION
The comparative analysis of the morphometric and molecular biological characteristics of femoral head tissue in different nosological entities of coxarthrosis indicated a number of peculiar features.
The most specific manifestations of certain morphological and molecular biological signs were identified for each nosological entity of coxarthrosis.
