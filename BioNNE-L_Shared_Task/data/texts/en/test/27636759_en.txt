Effect of long term application of toothpaste Apadent Total Care Medical nano-hydroxyapatite.
The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of toothpaste «Apadent Total Care» containing nanocalciumhydroxyapatite and its influence on caries resistance of tooth enamel and teeth sensitivity.
The study involved 30 people: 15 patients aged 17-25 years and 15 aged 35-44 years.  Study participants used «Apadent Total Care» toothpaste with nanocalciumhydroxyapatite.
To evaluate the effectiveness of toothpastes clinical assessment of enamel remineralization rate was carried out, as well as the dynamics of enamel acid resistance and teeth sensitivity (Shiff index).
Clinical evaluation of tooth enamel before the procedure and after 3 months of use of toothpaste with nanohydroxyapatite showed the improvement of all indices.  Time for complete remineralisation of enamel in both groups did not exceed 3 days.
Acid resistance of tooth enamel increased by 1.65 in group I and 1,75 in group II.
The Schiff index after 3 months of using «Apadent» toothpaste also decreased in both groups.
