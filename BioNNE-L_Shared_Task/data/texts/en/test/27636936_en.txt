[Pulmonary manifestations in adult patients with a defect in humoral immunity].  Primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) are a group of congenital diseases of the immune system, which numbers more than 230 nosological entities associated with lost, decreased, or wrong function of its one or several components.
Due to the common misconception that these are extremely rare diseases that occur only in children and lead to their death at an early age, PIDs are frequently ruled out by physicians of related specialties from the range of differential diagnosis.
The most common forms of PIDs, such as humoral immunity defects, common variable immune deficiency, X-linked agammaglobulinemia, selective IgA deficiency, etc., are milder than other forms of PID, enabling patients to attain their adult age, and may even manifest in adulthood.
Bronchopulmonary involvements are the most common manifestations of the disease in patients with a defect in humoral immunity.  Thus, a therapist and a pulmonologist are mostly the first doctors who begin to treat these patients and play a key role in their fate, since only timely diagnosis and initiation of adequate therapy can preserve not only the patient's life, but also its quality, avoiding irreversible complications.
Chest computed tomography changes play a large role in diagnosis.
These are not specific for PID; however, there are a number of characteristic signs that permit this diagnosis to be presumed.
