[Structural variations of the genome in autistic spectrum disorders with intellectual disability].
AIM  To analyze structural variations in the genome in children with autism and intellectual disability.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Using high-resolution karyotyping (AffymetrixCytoScan HD Array) and original bioinformatic technology, 200 children with autism and intellectual disability were studied.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Data on structural variations in the genome in children with autism and intellectual disability are provided.
Causative genomic pathology (chromosome abnormalities and copy number variations - CNV) was determined in 97 cases (48.5%).  Based on these
RESULTS  24 candidate genes for autism with intellectual disability were selected.
In 16 cases (8%), the chromosome mosaicism manifested as aneuploidy of whole autosomes and sex chromosomes (gonosomes) was identified.  In 87 children (43.5%), there were genomic variations, which are characteristic of the so-called «grey zone» of genetic pathology in mental illnesses.
Bioinformatic analysis showed that these genomic variations had a pleiotropic effect on the phenotype.
