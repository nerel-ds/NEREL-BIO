[Therapy for primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma in accordance with the R-DA-EPOCH-21 program: The first results].  AIM
to evaluate the efficiency of the R-DA-EPOCH-21 + R-DHAP protocol and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (a BEAM conditioning mode) in first-line therapy for primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL).
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
In 2013 to 2016, the investigation enrolled 57 patients with newly diagnosed PMBCL (according to the 2008 WHO criteria).
The results were analyzed in 40 patients who had completed their treatment.
RESULTS
All the 40 patients (14 men and 26 women) (median age, 27 years (19 to 67 years)) received 6 cycles of polychemotherapy (PCT) in accordance with the R-DA-EPOCH-21 regimen.
After induction PCT cycles, 32/40 (80%) patients achieved complete remission.
Partial remission was stated in 8/40 (20%) patients who had further 2 cycles of chemotherapy using the R-DHAP program and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (a BEAM conditioning mode).
Two-year overall and relapse-free survival rates were 100% and 96%, respectively; the median follow-up was 17 months.
CONCLUSION
The R-DA-EPOCH regimen allows complete remission in 80% of the cases and two-year survival in 100%.
If there are unfavorable factors at onset and in partial remission, it is appropriate to intensify treatment at early stages, by using high-dose chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic stem transplantation.
