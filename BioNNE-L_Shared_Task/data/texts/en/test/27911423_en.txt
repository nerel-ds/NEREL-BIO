[Core principles of treatment of corneal damage in patients with thyroid eye disease].
AIM
To develop a therapeutic approach and to estimate the efficiency of complex treatment of corneal damage in patients with thyroid eye disease (TED).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study enrolled 44 patients (52 eyes) divided into 2 groups depending on the severity of corneal damage.  Treatment of those with severe involvement included pathogenetic measures (pulse steroid therapy and/or radiation therapy) and surgery (orbital decompression, eyelid and corneal surgery).
RESULTS
As the result of the treatment, orbital inflammation decreased and the state of the cornea improved in all patients.  CONCLUSION
The treatment of corneal damage in patients with TED may differ depending on numerous factors, such as the severity of corneal damage and activity of orbital inflammation.
Taking into account the potential danger of corneal involvement, one should make efforts to early detection and management of the risk factors.
