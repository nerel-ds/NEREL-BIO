[Posterior decompression of the craniovertebral junction in children with Chiari malformation: a surgery extent issue].  AIM
The study objective was to develop a rational approach for defining the extent of posterior decompression in children with Chiari 1 malformation.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  Posterior decompression was performed in 76 children with Chiari 1 malformation, under 18 years of age, in the period between 2001 and 2015.
Fifty two (68%) children had syringomyelia.
Extradural decompression (EDD) was performed in 14 (18%) cases, extra-arachnoid duraplasty (EAD) in 21 (28%) cases, intra-arachnoid dissection and duraplasty in 21 (28%) cases, and foramen of Magendie stenting and duraplasty in 20 (26%) cases.
RESULTS
Complications occurred in 15 (20%) patients, with one of them being fatal (case fatality rate, 1.3%).
The complication rate was higher after (1) intra-arachnoid dissection (p=0.0009) and stenting (p=0.02).
Re-operation was required in 8 (11%) patients.
The overall rate of complications and re-operations was lowest after EAD (10%).
CONCLUSION
EAD is the method of choice for Chiari 1 malformation in children.
EDD can be adopted as a primary option, but it requires selection of relevant patients.
Intra-arachnoid dissection, with/without stenting, is not advisable as a primary intervention, but may be inevitable in the re-operation case.
