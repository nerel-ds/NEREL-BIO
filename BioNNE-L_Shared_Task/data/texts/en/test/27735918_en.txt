[Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and biliary sludge in people with metabolic syndrome].  AIM
To determine the incidence of biliary sludge (BS) and to evaluate the clinical efficacy of Chophytol in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and BS in the presence of metabolic syndrome (MS).
SUBJECTS AND METHODS  Clinical laboratory examination was made in 72 patients with NASH in the presence of MS.
BS was identified in 52 (72.2%) examinees who were divided in two (study and control) groups.  The efficacy of Chophytol of plant origin, prepared from the purified extract of fresh artichoke (Cynara scolymus) leaf juice, which was used at a dose of 3 tablets thrice daily for a month, was evaluated.
RESULTS
The use of Chophytol was established to promote BS elimination in 87% of the patients.
This ceased pain syndrome in 87% and dyspeptic manifestations in 65.2% and normalized the levels of lipids and the biochemical indicators of liver process activity.
No adverse drug reactions were seen.
CONCLUSION
Chophytol used in patients with HASH and BS may soon be possible to make general condition better, to alleviate the symptoms of diseases of the liver and biliary system, and to appreciably improve the biochemical indicators of blood and bile.
