[Possibilities of treatment optimization in children and adolescents with epilepsy and disturbances of emotion and volition (disphoria)].
AIM
To optimize the treatment of dysphoriain children and adolescents in regard to sex and disease severity.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Seventy children and adolescents (boys - 45, girls - 25), aged from 6 to 18 years, with different forms of epilepsy and emotion and dysphoric disturbances were studied using CPRS andGCIscales Depending on dysphoria severity, patients were stratified into three groups: mild  (n=19 (27.1%), moderate (n=27 (38.6%)) and severe (n=24 (34.3%)).
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  Dysphoric disorders were significantly more prevalent in boys, hostility and aggression were characteristic of boys as well.
These facts impactedtreatment options.  Neuroleptics were more frequently used in boys (35.5%) compared to girls(16%).Mild dysphoria didnot require additional treatment besides AED in 78,4%.
In 75% cases of moderate dysphoria,systemic treatment with neuroleptics for 6 months was necessary.  One-time recommendations for neuroleptic treatment were made in all three groups with the prevalence in a groupof children with severe and moderate dysphoria.
