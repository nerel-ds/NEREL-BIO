[The choice of surgery in patients with diffuse toxic goiter].
AIM  to define clear individual indications for different operations for diffuse toxic goiter by research of immunological markers of thyrotoxicosis recurrence probability.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Long-term results of survey and treatment of 215 patients with diffuse toxic goiter are presented.  Patients were divided into 2 groups.
The 1st group consisted of 31 patienrs who underwent conventional partial thyroidectomy.  Group 2 included 184 patients.
They were divided into 2 subgroups depending on type of surgery.
Subgroup A included 59 patients after partial thyroidectomy and subgroup B - 125 patients after total thyroidectomy.  In group 2 surgery was defined based on only level of antibodies against TSH-receptors.
RESULTS
Recurrence incidence was 16 and 0% in groups 1 and 2 respectively.
CONCLUSION
In patients with diffuse toxic goiter partial thyroidectomy is possible if normal titer of antibodies against TSH-receptors is present (<1.5 U/l).
Total thyroidectomy is advisable in titer â‰¥1.5 U/l.
