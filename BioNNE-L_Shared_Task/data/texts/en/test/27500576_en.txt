[The low-invasive treatment of laryngotrachealstenoses].  The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of balloonlaryngotracheoplasty for the treatment of laryngeal and tracheal stenosis We undertook the analysis of the case histories of the patients presenting withlaryngotracheal stenosis who had undergone balloonlaryngotracheoplasty during the period from October 2013 till February 2016.
A total of 21 histories of the patients (6 men and 15 women) were available for the investigation.
Most laryngotrachealstenoses that occurred in 18 (85.7%) patients were of the idiopathic, post-tracheotomy, and post-intubation types.
Their most typical localization was the subfold part of the larynx and/or the upper third of the trachea (76.2%).  The length of the stenotic lesions varied from 5 to 20 mm (76.2%) and corresponded to grade III if estimated based on the Cotton-Myer classification (81%).
The number of the balloonlaryngotracheoplastic procedures ranged from 1 to 4 (a total of 36 operations).  The interval between the consecutive interventions varied from 1.5 to 104 (mean 20) weeks.
In 16 of the 36 cases, dilatation of the narrowed portion was followed by the 4 minute application of mitomycin C at a concentration of 0.4 mg/kg.
No complications were documented during the surgical interventions and in the postoperative periods.
The treatment was associated with a significant enhancement of the maximum expiratory flow rate from 2±1.13 l/s to 4.23±1.9 l/s (p=0.000).
The duration of the follow up period varied from 1 to 105 (mean 36.2) weeks.
Mitomycin C exerted nosignificant influence on the increment of the maximum expiratory flow rate (p=0.174).
