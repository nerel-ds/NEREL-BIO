[Mental disorders in patients with acromegaly].
AIM  To study mental disorders in acromegaly due to somatotropinoma.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 115 consecutively recruited patients with acromegaly (95 female and 20 male, aged from 21 to 78 years).
Acromegaly was diagnosed by endocrinologists according to current guidelines based on clinical, laboratory data and brain MRI.
All patients underwent a clinical psychiatric interview based on ICD-10 criteria.  The Mini-Mental State Examination scale and Hypomania-Checklist (HCL-32) were used.
RESULTS
Mental disorders were diagnosed in 79.1% of patients.  Organic spectrum disorders were found in 46.1%, bipolar spectrum disorders in 35.7%, schizophrenia spectrum disorders in 4.3%.
The patients with bipolar spectrum disorders had significantly lower serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels compared to patients with organic spectrum disorders (p=0.01).
The presence of organic spectrum disorders was associated with older age and number of somatic comorbidities (Ñ€=0.0001 and 0.001).
CONCLUSION
The prevalence of bipolar, organic and schizophrenia spectrum disorders in patients with acromegaly exceeds that in the general population.
Significantly lower IGF-1 levels in acromegalic patients with bipolar disorders, compared to those with organic disorders, can have some implications to their pathogenesis.
