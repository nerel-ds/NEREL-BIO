[Effect of angioprotective therapy with bioflavonoids on endothelial dysfunction in patients with acute venous thromboses].  The study was aimed at evaluating a possibility of correcting endothelial dysfunction by means of angioprotective therapy with natural-origin bioflavonoids in patients presenting with acute venous thromboses.
Ours was an open comparative prospective study including a total of thirty 34-to-60-year-old patients suffering from lower limb deep vein thrombosis.
The patients were subdivided into two groups.
The Study Group was composed of 15 patients receiving on the background of anticoagulant therapy with direct thrombin inhibitors (dabigatran etexilate at a daily dose of 300 mg) natural-origin angioprotectors (red grape leaf extract).
The Control Group also consisted of 15 patients undergoing anticoagulant therapy with direct thrombin inhibitors alone.
Blood sampling for laboratory monitoring [the quantitative level of von Willebrand factor (vWF) in blood plasma, integral assessment of the links of blood coagulation and fibrinolysis by means of thromboelastography] and ultrasonographic angioscanning of lower extremities were carried out in both Group twice: at the beginning of the study and 3 months after the beginning of therapy.
The absolute majority of patients demonstrated a quantitative increase in vWF (the median in the Study Group amounted to 208.3%, being 190.0% in the Control Group, with the cut-off level equaling 140.8%).
Assessing dynamics of the vWF level after 3 months on the background of using natural-origin flavonoids (the Study Group) showed a more pronounced decrease in the vWF level in the Study Group patients as compared with the Control Group patients (98.4%).
Comparing the dynamic composite indices of the thromboelastogram revealed that with similar parameters in patients from the Study and Control Groups at admission, in dynamics there was observed greater growth of the level of indices of the process of dissolution of the fibrin clot (lysis) in the Study Group as compared to the Control Group.
Also noted was more pronounced recanalization of the venous bed in patients taking the natural-origin bioflavonoid.
A conclusion was drawn that including angioprotectors (red vine leaf extract) into the comprehensive therapy in order to correct endothelial dysfunction may improve the immediate results and terms of treatment of patients with acute venous thrombosis.
