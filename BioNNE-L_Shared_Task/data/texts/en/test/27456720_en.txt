[Uncompleted suicide attempts in adolescents].
AIM  To analyze the characteristics of suicidal behavior, which was the reason of urgent admission to the psychiatric hospital, in adolescents.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Clinical and psychopathological analysis was performed for 143 adolescents, 55 boys and 88 girls, aged 15-17 years, admitted to a Moscow psychiatric hospital due to suicidal behavior.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Among all hospitalized on medical emergencies suicidal behavior was identified in 42%, repeated suicidal attempts were in 27% of boys and in 47% of girls.
Mental disorders on admission and in the past history were found in 75%; 25% of the patients received psychiatric examination and treatment.
Personality disorders and adaptation disorders were most prevalent; schizophrenia spectrum disorders made up 13%.
Common features of suicidal behavior in adolescents were: the use of low fatal methods, mild expression of antivital feelings, short duration of pre-suicidal stage, suddenness of commitment of suicidal actions, an additional stressful event (conflict situation) for the development of suicidal behavior.
Significant differences in the methods of realization of suicidal intentions, preferable character of suicidal behavior (blackmailing/demonstrative in girls, brutal and compulsive in boys) and typology of psychopathological symptoms were established.
