[The application of intravascular laser irradiation of blood for the correction of the immune disturbances in patients presenting with chronic endometritis].  The objective of the present study was to elucidate the specific features of the immune disturbances in patients presenting with chronic endometritis and to correct them with the help of the application of low-intensity intravascular laser radiation of blood in the combination with the standard treatment.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
The study included 30 women of the reproductive age with the verified diagnosis of chronic endometritis at the stage of partial remission.  The patients were divided into two groups.
The patients of group 1 (control) were treated by pharmacotherapy alone while those in the main group (group 2) were given standard therapy supplemented by intravascular laser irradiation of blood in the form of daily 25 min sessions during a 7 day period with the use of the «Mulatto» device having the output power of 2 MW at a wavelength of 0.63 microns.
In addition, the third group of comparison was formed to which age-matched healthy women were recruited.
The levels of cytokines, components of the complement, and immunoglobulins were determined in blood plasma, vaginal and cervical washouts using solid-phase enzyme immunoassay.
RESULTS
The more reliable correction of the immune disturbances was achieved with the use of low-intensive laser irradiation of blood in comparison with medicamental therapy alone as appears from the analysis of the indicators of the immune status at the systemic and local levels (anti-inflammatory and regulatory cytokines, components and regulators of the system of complement, immunoglobulins).
CONCLUSION
Supplementation of the standard treatment of chronic endometritis by a course of intravascular low-intensive laser irradiation of blood allows to increase its effectiveness and thereby improve the quality of life of the patients.
