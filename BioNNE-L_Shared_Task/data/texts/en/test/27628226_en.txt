[Absence of postoperative pulmonary impermeability in patients with spontaneous pneumothorax].  AIM
to improve treatment of patients with spontaneous pneumothorax who had not postoperative pulmonary impermeability.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
87 patients with spontaneous pneumothorax underwent videothoracoscopy (VTS), lung resection supplemented by pleurodesis (parietal pleurectomy or pleural abrasion).
Absence of pulmonary impermeability was observed in 5 (5.7%) patients.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Re-operation was performed in 2 patients (Vanderschuren 2 and 3) namely re-thoracoscopy and thoracotomy with additional ligation of air origins.
Drainage tubes were removed in 4 and 17 days postoperatively in patient without/with emphysema respectively.
In patient (Vanderschuren 1) who underwent thoracoscopic resection and parietal pleural abrasion valve bronchoblocation was performed in 9 days after VTS due to persistent pneumothorax.
Pleural drainage tube was removed in 13 days (emphysema) after bronchial valve deployment.
2 patients (Vanderschuren 4) had heterogeneous pulmonary emphysema.
One of them underwent video-assisted mini-thoracotomy, lung resection with reinforcement of seams with synthetic material.
In other observation conversion to thoracotomy followed by atypical resection of bullous emphysema and manual suturing of lung was applied.
In both cases bronchoblocation was performed intraoperatively with good results.
Drainage tubes were removed in 13 and 17 days respectively.
There were no complications.
CONCLUSION
Intraoperative endoscopic bronchoblocation is advisable if air leakage is considerable in operating theater and complicates lung smoothing.
Such approach reduces hospital-stay and improves outcomes.
