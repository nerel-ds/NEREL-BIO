AIM  To assess the long-term results and quality of life of patients after different medical and tactical approaches in treatment of severe acute pancreatitis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Long-term outcomes were studied in 210 patients with severe acute pancreatitis for the period 2003-2013.
There were 144 (68.6%) men.
RESULTS
The quality of life of patients undergoing both aseptic (GIQLI - 112.9±1.3 points) and infected (GIQLI - 108.8±2.2 points) destructive complications of severe pancreatitis is lower (p=0.00001) compared with healthy population.
Reccurence of acute pancreatitis was observed in 27.6% of patients.
Diabetes mellitus developed in 40.5% and 23.6% of patients after infected and aseptic complications of severe pancreatitis respectively.
Exocrine insufficiency was detected in 32.6% and 38.2% of patients who underwent aseptic and infected complications respectively.
Postoperative hernia was observed in 30.8% of patients.  Herewith, hernias (p<0.05) are predominantly formed after open operations (73,6%) than minimally invasive procedures (2.6%).
Chronic pseudocyst was detected in 13.0% of patients after aseptic complications of severe pancreatitis and in 17.6% after infected complications.
CONCLUSION
Quality of life and long-term outcomes are better in patients who were treated using only conservative methods and/or minimally invasive surgical interventions.
