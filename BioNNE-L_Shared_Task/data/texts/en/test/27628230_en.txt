[The consequences of cholecystectomy].  AIM
to analyze the consequences of cholecystectomy.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
348 patients were under observation within 10 Â years after cholecystectomy.  Surgery for destructive and chronic cholecystitis was performed in 115 and 233 patients respectively.
The consequences of cholecystectomy were assessed using bile acids level in blood plasma, stomach and duodenal pressure, pancreatic and stomach changes.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
It was established that lithocholic, deoxycholic, taurodeoxycholic acids were increased by 44% within 10 years after surgery.
At the same time glycocholic and tauroursodeoxycholic acids were decreased by 21.5% in 5 years after surgery.
Bile acids level changes were associated with changes of stomach and duodenal pressure.
The most pronounced disorders were observed in distal duodenum.
There was more than 2.8-fold excess of normal pressure in this area.
Duodenal hypertension was accompanied by pancreatic ducts enlargement in 9.5% of cases and increased echogenicity in 93% of cases.
CONCLUSION
Changes of the level and proportion of blood plasma bile acids and hypertension in upper gastrointestinal tract are the most important in chronic pancreatitis pathogenesis after cholecystectomy.
Such conditions occur within first 3 years after surgery.
