[An effect of quetiapine on the immune system of patients with schizophrenia].
AIM  To study an effect of the atypical antipsychotic quetiapine on the immune system of patients with schizophrenia with account for treatment efficacy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Quetiapine was administered to 27 patients diagnosed with residual schizophrenia (F20.5) for 6 weeks in dose 200-400 mg/day; dynamic of clinical symptoms was evaluated with PANSS Ð¸ CGI scales before administration of quetiapine and by week 6 of the treatment.
Along with clinical assessments, immune indices were determined.
RESULTS
At the end of week 6 of treatment, statistically significant changes of PANSS psychopathological symptoms were noted.
According to CGI scale, patients were divided into group 1 with high treatment efficacy (n=17) and group 2 with the low efficacy (n=10).
Significant between-group differences before treatment were as follows: the decreased number of lymphocytes of CD3+- CD16+-phenotypes, increased number of HLADR+-lymphocytes and IgA level in group 2.
The quetiapine therapy led to the positive dynamic of phagocytosis indices, CD16+-lymphocytes, decrease in the level of IgA.
CONCLUSION
Possible predictors of treatment efficacy were found including the number of mature T (CD3+) lymphocytes, CD16+ natural killers, HLADR+ lymphocytes and IgA concentrations.
