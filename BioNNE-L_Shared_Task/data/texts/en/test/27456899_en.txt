[Photomatrix LED therapy in patients with post-stroke arthropathy of the shoulder joint].
AIM  To assess the impact of quasi-monochromatic partially coherent infra-red radiation on the dynamics of recovery of the affected joint and the hemostatic system in patients with post-stroke arthropathy of the shoulder joint.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Fifty-five patients in the early, late and residual period of ischemic stroke were studied.
Group I consisted of 27 patients who underwent 10 sessions of photomatrix therapy (wavelength 600 nm) on the affected joint, lasting for 10 minutes.  In patients of group II (n=28), the duration of photomatrix therapy was 20 minutes.
Patients of the comparison group (n=20) did not receive photomatrix therapy.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The results pointed to a significant reduction in the severity of pain, increase in the range of motion in the shoulder joint.
All this was combined with a decrease in the severity of anxiety and depression, followed by a mild hypocoagulation effect and improvement of blood circulation in the paretic limb.
The authors point out to the prospect of using this method for the prevention and treatment of post-stroke arthropathy.
