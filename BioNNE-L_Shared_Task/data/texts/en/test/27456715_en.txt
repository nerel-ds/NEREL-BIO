[Neurological complications and outcomes of bacterial meningitis in children].
AIM  To analyze neurological complications and outcomes of bacterial meningitis (BM) in children.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Fifty-five patients with BM, aged from 2 months to 12 years, were examined.
Bacteriological study, clinical and biochemical blood tests and blood serology and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests as well as serum molecular-genetic study were performed.  Neuroimaging methods (neurosonography, computed (X-ray) tomography and brain magnetic resonance imaging) were used.
RESULTS AND Ð¡ONCLUSION
A key role of generalized meningococcal infection in the development of BM in children was confirmed.  Brain edema was an early and life-threatening complication of BM.
It was found in 9% of the patients with meningococcal infection, 7.3% with pneumococcal meningitis and 3.6% with haemophilus meningitis.  Changes in the brain structure were not found in 80% of the patients, in 20%, the residual stage of BM was characterized by cerebral destructive/proliferative or atrophic changes of different severity.
The dissociation between clinical and neuroimaging parameters and poor outcomes of BM, related to the complicated premorbid state, concomitant somatic/neurological pathology, BM severity, late laboratory diagnosis and untimely etiotropic antibacterial treatment, were identified in 65.5%.
