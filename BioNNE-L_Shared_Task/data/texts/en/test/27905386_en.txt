[Cognitive impairment in patients poluchennym ischemic stroke in the acute and early recovery periods in the process of neuroprotection low-dose drug cortexin].  AIM
To study the effect of repeated low-dose course of neuroprotection by drug cortexin on cognitive impairment in the acute and early recovery periods of hemispheric ischemic stroke.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study involved 90 patients with poluchennym ischemic stroke.  Patients of the first group received cortexin 20 mg (10+10) intramuscularly on the background of basic therapy, patients of the second group (n=30) received cortexin 20 mg (10+10) two courses for 10 days each with a break in between of 10 days, the patients of the third group - only basic therapy.
For the objectification of cognitive impairment used a scale MMSE, a test of 5 words, the battery of frontal dysfunction, clock drawing test, MOCA test.
RESULTS
It was noted more rapid and complete regression of cognitive disorders in patients of the 1st and 2nd groups, in comparison with patients of the 3rd group.
However, the best effect of the therapy was observed still in the group of patients treated with the double rate of the drug cortexin.
