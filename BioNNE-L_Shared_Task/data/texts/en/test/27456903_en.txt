[A study of the effect of the genes of inflammatory proteins on basic personality dimensions].
AIM  The present research examines the association between two basic dimensions of personality and genes of inflammatory cytokines and mediators reported to be elevated in schizophrenia and affective disorders.
Genes of interleukin-1B (IL-1B), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), C-reactive protein (CRP) and alpha 1-antitrypsin (A1AT) were studied.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
A total of 639 healthy subjects, aged from 17 to 69 years, participated in the study.
The following polymorphisms were genotyped: IL-1B С-511Т (rs16944) and С3954Т (rs1143634), IL-6 G-174C (rs1800795), TNF-α G-308A (rs1800629), CRP (rs279452), A1AT 374G/A (rs709932).
Basic personality dimensions Extraversion and Neuroticism were assessed using the Eysenck Personality Inventory.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The levels of Extraversion and Neuroticism were not associated with IL-1B, IL-6, TNF-α G and CRP polymorphisms.
The association between the A1AT 374G/A polymorphism and Extraversion (р=0.036) was shown.
There was a trend towards the association between the A1AT 374G/A polymorphism and Neuroticism (p=0,05) in women.
Because this is the first study of the effect of IL-1B, IL-6, TNF-α and A1AT on personality dimensions, the results should be considered as preliminary and need to be replicated.
