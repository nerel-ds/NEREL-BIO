[Types of immune response in advanced suppurative peritonitis].  AIM
to assess types of immune response in patients with advanced suppurative peritonitis and course of disease.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
We examined 79 patients with acute surgical abdominal diseases and injuries complicated by advanced suppurative peritonitis.  Blood immunological parameters were estimated using flowing cytometry and enzyme immunoassay.
RESULTS  It was concluded that functional parameters of immune system are very various in patients with advanced suppurative peritonitis.
Cluster analysis defined 4 immune types which are determined by different state of congenital and acquired immunity.  Immunodeficient and unreactive immune types are unfavorable.
Immune types with activation of congenital and acquired immunity are the most favourable.
This stratification personifies diagnosis and treatment of immune disorders in patients with advanced suppurative peritonitis.
