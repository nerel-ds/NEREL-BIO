[Latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA): The informative value of autoantibodies].
AIM  To investigate the prevalence of autoantibodies (autoAbs) associated with the development of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA) in the Russian Federation.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
A total of 96 patients (46 women and 50 men) with LADA were examined.
All the patients underwent an immunological examination including the determination of autoAbs, such as glutamic acid decarboxylase autoAbs (GADA), islet antigen-2 auto-Abs (IA-2A), islet cell cytoplasmic auto-Abs (ICA), zinc transporter 8 auto-Abs (ZnT8A), and insulin auto-Abs (IAA).
RESULTS
GADAs were found in 61.5% of the examinees.
ICAs were detected in 24%, IA-2As were observed in 57.3%.
AutoAbs were more frequently observed in combination than alone.
IAAs were least commonly seen in 8.3% and only in combinations.
ZnT8As were found in 52.1% of the examinees and they were present alone in 5.2%.
CONCLUSION
The antibodies that are most frequently observed in LADA are GADAs, IA-2As and ZnT8As.
It is insufficient to identify only GADAs, as the latter are found in only 61.5% of the patients.
IA-2As and ZnT8As, which are present in 57.3% and 52.1% of the patients, respectively, should also be used in the diagnosis of LADA.
ICAs are much less commonly seen and along with IAAs may be additional markers for LADA.
