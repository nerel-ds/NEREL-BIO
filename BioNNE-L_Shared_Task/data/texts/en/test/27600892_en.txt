[Potentials of intraoperative navigation during balanced orbital bony decompression in thyroid eye disease (preliminary results)].  UNLABELLED
Precise instrument localization is of great importance in orbital decompression surgery.  Different navigation systems were designed to fulfill this task and gained wide acceptance.
AIM  to describe principal features and determine advantages of intraoperatively navigated orbital bony decompression.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Data on orbital decompression surgery performed with or without intraoperative image guidance is presented.  Each time two surgeons were involved - an ophthalmologist (lateral wall decompression) and otolaryngologist (medial wall decompression).
RESULTS  In lateral wall decompression, electromagnetic navigation was mostly used to enlarge the created bone window upward and backward, which is particularly challenging in case of bone thinning in the posterior part of its inner rim.
In transethmoidal decompression, the image guidance allowed a more extensive removing of the greater sphenoid wing as well as the posterior medial wall where it joins the lateral wall of the sphenoid sinus.  As shown by MSCT, lateral rectus muscle dislocation into the created bone window was more significant in navigated procedures.
CONCLUSION
This preliminary data convincingly shows advantages and potentials of the use of electromagnetic navigation in orbital decompression surgery, especially, for optic neuropathy in thyroid eye disease patients.
