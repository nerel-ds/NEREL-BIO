AIM  To evaluate the effectiveness of eyelid hygiene in patients with chronic allergic blepharoconjunctivitis (ABC) as a part of their preparation for laser refractive surgery.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study involved 32 patients (12 males and 20 females aged 25-42 years) with refractive errors, namely, compound myopic astigmatism (23 patients) and hyperopic astigmatism (9 patients) suffering from chronic ABC and secondary dry eye syndrome (DES).
All the patients initially received a standard treatment for ABC and DES, that is olopatodin hydrochloride instillations - 1 mg/ml 2 times daily, preservative-free hyaluronic acid preparation - 1 mg/ml 3 times daily, and polyacrylic acid and dexpanthenol gel at night for one month.  The scheme, however, appeared not effective enough.
Hence, the patients were prescribed eyelid hygiene (Blepharolotion or Blepharosalfetka plus Blepharogel-1 2 times daily) to relive meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD).  They also underwent a conventional ophthalmic examination, allergy tests, evaluation of ABC and DES signs and symptoms, tear film break-up time test, Schirmer's test, meibomian glands evaluation, optical coherence tomography with meniscometry, xerosis index evaluation, and lissamine green staining for lid wiper epitheliopathy.
RESULTS
At the beginning of the study signs and symptoms of MGD-associated DES were predominant in all patients.
Chronic ABC signs were mild.
In 2-3 months, meibomian gland function and tear film break-up time improved significantly in most patients, while xerosis index decreased and lid wiper epitheliopathy resolved.
Laser refractive surgery (LASIK) was performed in 81.25% of patients, all of whom were satisfied with the results.
CONCLUSION
Inclusion of eyelid hygiene into preoperative management of patients with chronic ABC and DES allows to achieve optimum conditions for laser refractive surgery in most cases.
