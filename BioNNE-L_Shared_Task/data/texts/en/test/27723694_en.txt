[Free autovenous graft with destructed valves in treatment of severe ischemia of lower extremities].  AIM
to improve treatment of patients with severe atherosclerotic lesion of lower extremities arteries followed by critical ischemia by optimization of femoropopliteal bypass surgery.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Treament and survey of 60 patients with severe atherosclerotic lesion of femoropopliteotibial segment and critical lower limb ischemia were analyzed.  Patients were divided into 2 groups depending on technique of femoropopliteal bypass.
Conventional in situ autovenous technique was used in group 1.  In the second group we used original method of free autovenous graft with destructed valves.
RESULTS  Technique of free autovenous graft with destructed valves decreases incidence of early postoperative complications by 13.3%, remote thrombosis of graft by 13.3%.
Also it increases physical and mental components of health by 7.9% and 3.1% respectively.
CONCLUSION
Use of free autovenous graft with destructed valves is reasonable and improves results of treatment.
