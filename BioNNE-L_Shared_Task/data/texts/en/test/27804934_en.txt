[The factors affecting the results of mechanical jaundice management].
AIM  To improve the results of obstructive jaundice management by rational diagnostic and treatment strategies.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Outcomes of 820 patients with obstructive jaundice syndrome were analyzed.
RESULTS
Diagnostic and tactical mistakes were made at pre-hospital stage in 143 (17.4%) patients and in 105 (12.8%) at hospital stage.
Herewith, in 53 (6.5%) cases the errors were observed at all stages.
Retrospective analysis of severe postoperative complications and lethal outcomes in patients with obstructive jaundice showed that in 23.8% of cases they were explained by diagnostic and tactical mistakes at various stages of examination and treatment.
CONCLUSION
We developed an algorithm for obstructive jaundice management to reduce the number of diagnostic and tactical errors, a reduction in the frequency of diagnostic and tactical errors.
It reduced the number of postoperative complications up to 16.5% and mortality rate to 3.0%.
