[The use of L-lysine aescinat in the treatment of microcirculatory disturbances in patients young and middle age with violation of the intracranial venous outflow].
AIM
To study the efficacy of L-lysine aescinat in the treatment of vascular and microvascular disorders in patients with cerebral venous dystonia.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Sixty-eight patients, 25 male and 43 female, aged from 25 to 56 years, with disturbances of venous cerebral blood circulation and venous outflow difficulties were examined.  The examination included the assessment of cerebral hemodynamics using the algorithm of complex ultrasound examinations and functional status of the microcirculation by the laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) at baseline and 10 days after treatment with L-lysine aescinat.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
L-lysine aescinat improves intracranial venous outflow, significantly improves the functioning of microcirculation, while not affecting the normal type of microcirculation or changing it in the direction of improvement of hemodynamic parameters, has a modulating effect on the autonomic response, and can be recommended in the complex treatment of young and middle aged patients with disturbances of cerebral venous blood circulation with the predominance of vagotonia as well as hypersympathicotonia.
