[PAD prevalence in Russian Federation].  BACKGROUND  Currently there is no data on peripheral arterial disease prevalence in Russia.  AIM
To estimate prevalence of patients with symptomatic low limb ischemia (LLI) in Russian Federation on 2014.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
«League for patient' protection» had sent questionnaires for all regional health departments asking to name prevalence of ICD-10 codes I70.2 (atherosclerosis of arteries of extremities) and I73.1 (thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger)) on 2014.
The figures were listed separately for ischemia I-IIa and III-IV (critical limb ischemia, CLI) (Pokrovsky, 1976). Also were mentioned major amputations and mortality.
RESULTS
Total number of received questionnaires was 44, we've got information from all RF' federal regions with a population of appr.  71 million people.
There were 174 125 cases of symptomatic LLI.
Prevalence of symptomatic LLI among Russian population aged more than 40 years was 0.51%.  Prevalence of intermittent claudication was 0.36% and of critical limb ischemia - 0.13%.
Rate of major amputations was 6.9%.
CONCLUSION
World PAD prevalence among people older than 25 years is 8.3%.
The same figure in our study was only 0.5%.
This is due to the fact that we considered only symptomatic LLI and only with codes I70.2 and I73.1. Prevalence of symptomatic patients among all PAD patients is 10-35%.
So the real number of PAD patients in Russian might be 1.5-5%.
We can conclude that PAD is still unrevealed in Russia.  Another conclusion could be that the treatment results are less than satisfactory.
Finally there is urgent necessity for special PAD register in RF.
