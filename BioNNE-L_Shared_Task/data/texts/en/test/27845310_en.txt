[The clinical dynamics of mental retardation and social adaptation of patients as they get older].
AIM  To establish the patterns of social adaptation of patients with mental retardation (MR) as they get older in relation to the clinical dynamics of MR, to analyze the association between the formation of MR and factors and circumstances that determine the adaptive capacity of patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
One hundred and eighty-seven patients with MR were followed-up from childhood to young adulthood (23-25 years old).
The average duration of follow-up was 17.7Â±3.7 years.
Clinical-psychopathological method was the main method of research.
To assess social functioning of patients, the registration card of social skills in adolescents with chronic mental disorders and the questionnaire for assessment of social functioning and quality of life of mentally ill people were used.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  About 90% of young adults with mild MR got a professional education, but only about 40% had permanent jobs, 35% had temporary income.
80% of patients with moderate mental retardation did not work, less than 10% had temporary jobs.
The status of the disabled person received in childhood, has been preserved in most patients.
Several early risk factors of predisposition to MR were identified.  It has been established that the level of social adaptation of patients is correlated with the severity of intellectual deficit and depends on some external factors.
