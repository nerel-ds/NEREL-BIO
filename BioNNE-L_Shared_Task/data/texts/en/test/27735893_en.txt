[Neurological complications in patients with diabetes mellitus type 1 treated with different methods of insulinotherapy].  The study aims to examine the neurological complications of patients with type 1 diabetes treated with different methods of insulin therapy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Thirty-four patients, aged from 18 to 40 years, with diabetes mellitus type 1 receiving insulinotherapy, with a duration of the disease 14.25±9.25 years, have been examined.
By the time of the study the patients of the first group have been treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy (CSII) for 4.5±1.5 years following 11.3±5.4 years of standard basal-bolus therapy; the patients of the second group have been treated with basal-bolus insulin therapy for 12.7±7.7 years.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Neurological status and the presence of vegetative symptoms of the patients were assessed, following tests were performed: MMSE, MoCA, HADS, TSS, NSS, NDS.
