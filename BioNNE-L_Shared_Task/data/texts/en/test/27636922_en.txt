[Non-drug rehabilitation of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease concurrent with hypertension].
AIM  to evaluate the efficiency of decimeter wave therapy and halotherapy, which were additionally added to basic therapy, in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) concurrent with hypertension at the inpatient stage.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
36 patients aged 20 to 75 years with Stages I-II COPD concurrent with Stages I-II, first-second grade hypertension were examined and treated.
The clinical examination included collection of complaints and medical history data, clinical laboratory and instrumental (electrocardiography, spirography) studies, and health-related quality of life (using the SF-36 questionnaire).
The patients were randomized into two groups: a study group and a comparison group.
The study group patients received decimeter wave therapy and halotherapy in addition to basic drug treatment; the comparison patients had basic drug therapy.
RESULTS
Pre- and postoperative comparative analysis of the major clinical manifestations of comorbidities revealed more pronounced positive changes with the lower rate of clinical manifestations in the study group.
It was also observed to have a more marked reduction in blood pressure (BP) with its goal levels achieved.  The mean pulse BP decreased by 28% in the study group (p=0.000005) and did not statistically reduced in the comparison group.
In the study group patients, the integral quality-of-life indicator after a package of medical rehabilitation measures became statistically significantly higher by 35%.  This indicator in the comparison group was statistically significantly unchanged.
CONCLUSION
The directionality of the proposed rehabilitation complex towards the common pathogenetic components of the development and progression of COPD and hypertension, as well as the high efficiency of the complex justify its appropriate inclusion in the combination treatment and rehabilitation of this category of patients.
