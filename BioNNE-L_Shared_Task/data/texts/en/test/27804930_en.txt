[Endoscopic treatment of cicatricial esophageal strictures using ionized argon plasma (with commentary)].
AIM
To estimate an efficacy of endoscopic treatment of benign cicatricial esophageal strictures using ionized argon plasma.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
It is presented treatment of 35 patients with post-ambustial and 17 patients with peptic strictures of the esophagus.
Their age ranged from 17 to 73 years.  Esophageal stenosis achieved 0.1-1.0 cm.
Local, tubular and prolonged stenoses were observed in 18 (51.5%), 3 (8.6%) and 14 (39.9%) patients respectively.  Peptic stenoses were local in 100% of cases and localized in lower esophagus before cardia.
RESULTS
Endoscopic techique resulted good and satisfactory outcomes in 53.8% and 27% of cases within short terms.  The best results were obtained in case of local post-ambustial and peptic ulcers.
At the end of treatment inflammation and mitotic activity were decreased in mucosa and submucosa of the narrowed segment.  Also thickness of the epithelium and stratification of tissue layers were normal.
Connective tissue volume was moderately decreased in subepithelial area.
