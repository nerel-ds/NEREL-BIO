[Current aspects of endothelial protection in treatment of patients with chronic venous insufficiency at the stage of trophic disorders].  The authors analysed the results of comprehensive examination and treatment of a total of 40 patients presenting with lower limb chronic venous insufficiency at the stage of trophic disorders (class C6), including 28 (70%) patients with varicose disease of lower extremities and 12 (30%) patients with post-thrombotic disease.
Studying the microcirculatory blood flow by means of laser Doppler flowmetry showed a statistically significant (p<0.05) baseline decrease in the index of microcirculation in patients (12.2±2.4 perf. units for varicose disease and 10.8±1.8 perf. units for post-thrombotic disease) as compared with the control group of apparently healthy volunteers (20.4±1.5 perf. units).
All stages of treatment included the program of stimulation of reparative processes and normalization of microcirculation by means of sulodexide.
Conservative measures were independent therapeutic procedures in 31 patients.
Of these, trophic ulcers completely epithelialized in 9 patients and decreased by half of its initial surface in 22 patients.
The study of the microcirculatory blood flow in dynamics suggested improvement of microcirculation during treatment.
Hence, comprehensive therapy using sulodexide in patients with venous trophic ulcers is accompanied by an endothelium-protecting effect and leads to improvement of the indices of microcirculation of the skin of the crus.
