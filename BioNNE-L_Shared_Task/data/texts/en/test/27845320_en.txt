[Perfusion computed tomography in the diagnosis of mild brain injury].
AIM  To evaluate and compare the characteristics of the regional cerebral blood flow in patients with mild cerebral concussion or injury using the results of perfusion computed tomography (CT).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Thirty-eight men, aged 18-35 years, including 21 with concussion and 17 with mild cranial/brain injury (CBI), were examined at the early stage of disease.
The control group consisted of 7 age-matched men with non-confirmed CBI.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The results of CT-perfusion revealed generalized changes in the hemodynamics.
There was a significant increase in the mean time and decrease in the total volume of blood flow through selected regions.
Hypoperfusion caused by generalized vasospasm was found in all patients at the early stage of mild CBI.  Focal disturbances of cerebral blood flow localized in the poles of the frontal and temporal lobes were determined in patients with mild brain injury compared to the patients with concussion.
The use of CT-perfusion can improve the diagnosis of mild CBI.
