[Lung-preserving surgical treatment of patients with bronchial carcinoid]. Isolated bronchus resection for central cancer was performed in 25 patients including preoperative bronchoscopic removal of exophytic tumor in 20 (80%) observations in thoracic department of P. Gertsen Moscow Research Cancer Institute. According to morphological study typical carcinoid was diagnosed in 23 (92%) patients, atypical - in 2 (8%) cases.  All patients underwent conventional mediastinal lymphadenectomy. Postoperative complications after bronchus resection developed in 6 (33.3%) patients.  There were no deaths.
