[Lung ultrasonography for the diagnosis of pneumonia in pregnant women with blood system tumors]. 
AIM  To estimate the informative value of ultrasonography (USG) in the diagnosis of lung injuries in pregnant women with blood system tumors. 
SUBJECTS AND METHODS Lung ultrasound was performed in 5 pregnant patients with blood cancers. 
The women's age was 29-38 years; gestational age was 14-33 weeks. 
Four women had different types of acute leukemia; one had primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma. 
All the women received chemotherapy for blood cancer. 
When there were signs of lung injury, USG was conducted, the results of which necessitated therapy or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). 
RESULTS Three patients developed acute respiratory failure; 2 of them required noninvasive ventilation. 
Based on the detection of consolidation with a dynamic air bronchogram and pleural effusion, the authors diagnosed bilateral pneumonia and alveolar-interstitial syndrome in 1 patient, right-sided pneumonia in 1, left-sided one in 1, and transfusion-related pulmonary edema in 1. 
Lung ultrasound did not verify the diagnosis of pneumonia in 1 patient. 
According to USG data, BAL procedures were performed in 2 patients; one of them was diagnosed as having Pneumocystis pneumonia; the other was found to have no pathogens in lavage fluid. 
Treatment resulted in clinical improvements and normalization of the lung ultrasound pattern in all the pregnant women. 
Later on, 4 women delivered via cesarean section done at 32-34 weeks' gestation and gave birth to healthy babies. 
One patient died from infectious complications after chemotherapy. 
CONCLUSION Lung sound may be used to diagnose lung injury in pregnant women with blood cancers.
