[Endogenous erythropoietin, acute kidney injury, and prognosis in patients with acute coronary syndrome]. AIM  To investigate the prognostic value of serum endogenous erythropoietin (EPO) in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), including that in the development of acute kidney injury (AKI). SUBJECTS AND METHODS Eighty-four patients (46 men, 38 women; mean age 63 Â± 11 years) with ACS were examined. Twenty-one (25%) patents were diagnosed with ECG ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (STSEAMI), 12 (14%) had ECG non-STSEAMI, and 51 (61%) had unstable angina. Thrombolytic therapy was performed in 10 (48%) patients with STSEAMI. The patients whom had not undergone coronarography were included in the investigation to exclude the nephrotoxic effect of X-ray contrast agents. RESULTS AKI was observed in 7 of the patients with acute myocardial infarction and in only 1 of those with unstable angina. Four (5%) patients died during hospitalization. The EPO level of > 10.5 IU/ml predicted the development of AKI in the ACS patients with a sensitivity of 71% and a specificity of 67%. That of > 13.7 IU/ml was associated with hospital death in the ACS patients with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 75% (AUC = 0.93%). CONCLUSION High serum EPO levels in an ACS patent during his hospital stay may serve as a biomarker for a high risk for AKI and high death rates.
