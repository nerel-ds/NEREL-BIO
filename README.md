# NEREL-BIO: Biomedical Corpus for Nested Named Entity Recognition

This project presents NEREL-BIO -- an annotation scheme and corpus of PubMed abstracts in Russian and in English. NEREL-BIO extends the general domain dataset [NEREL](https://github.com/nerel-ds/NEREL). [NEREL-BIO annotation scheme](https://github.com/nerel-ds/NEREL-BIO/blob/master/nerel-bio-guidelines.pdf) covers both general and biomedical domains making it suitable for domain transfer experiments.

## News

`Ferbuary 2025` We are pleased to announce the BioNNE-L (Biomedical Nested Named Entity Linking) Shared Task which will take place during the BioASQ 2025 Workshop co-located with CLEF 2025 hosted at Madrid, Spain, 9-12 September 2025. For more information, please visit [https://github.com/nerel-ds/NEREL-BIO/tree/master/bio-nne](https://github.com/nerel-ds/NEREL-BIO/tree/master/BioNNE-L_Shared_Task)

`September 2024` Our paper ["Overview of BioNNE Task on Biomedical Nested Named Entity Recognition at BioASQ 2024"](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3740/paper-03.pdf) has been published at CLEF 2024. 

`March 2024` Our paper about **nested entity linking** has been accepted to COLING 2024. For more information and new annotations, please visit https://github.com/nerel-ds/NEREL-BIO/tree/master/nested-mcn

`Ferbuary 2024` NEREL-BIO is being used as dataset for the BioNNE shared task on nested NER in English and Russian (BioASQ workshop, CLEF 2024). For more information, please visit https://github.com/nerel-ds/NEREL-BIO/tree/master/bio-nne

## Concept Normalization over Nested Entities

We release entity normalization (entity linking) annotation over nested entities, [see](https://github.com/nerel-ds/NEREL-BIO/tree/master/nested-mcn/data).
